"""
(ChatGPT:) In this Python script:

Shell commands have been replaced with equivalent subprocess.run() calls, and backticks for command substitution have been replaced with subprocess.getoutput() calls to get the output as a Python string.
Shell echo and read commands have been replaced with Python's print and input functions, respectively.
Note the warning about sourcing .bashrc â€“ you may want to reconsider if this is necessary, or handle it in another manner.
I kept the source command at the end for the issuework_setup_env.sh script, but you might want to translate this script to Python too, and replace this call with a function call to the Python equivalent.
TODO Remember, you would likely need to test and possibly adjust the script in a real environment to ensure it functions as expected, and handle any errors that might occur during the subprocess calls.
